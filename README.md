# CSE 11 Fall 2025 PA0 - Getting Started with CSE 11
**Due date: Thursday, October 2, 11:59 PM PDT**

## Learning Goals:

- Certify your commencement of academic activity in CSE 11
- Affirm your commitment to upholding academic integrity in CSE 11
- Install Java (Java 11 or later recommended)
- Install Visual Studio Code
- Write and compile a simple Java program
- Submit files to Gradescope

**NOTE: This programming assignment must be done individually.**

## Part 0: Prior Knowledge + Certification of Commencement of Academic Activity [0 points]

For every course at UC San Diego, per the US Department of Education, we
are **required** to certify whether students have commenced academic
activity for a class to count towards eligibility for Title IV federal
financial aid. This certification must be completed during the first two
weeks of instruction.

This requirement will be fulfilled via an **ungraded** "tell me about
yourself" quiz, which will assist the instructional team by providing
information about your background prior to the course. Complete this
quiz in [Canvas](https://canvas.ucsd.edu) by going to the
CSE 11 course and navigating to the Home tab. Under the Syllabus
drop-down tab, click \"First Day Survey: Prior Knowledge
#FinAid\" and complete the quiz.

## Part 1: Academic Integrity [0 points]

The CSE department supports the fundamental values of academic
integrity: honesty, respect, responsibility, fairness, trustworthiness,
and courage. Unlike courses from most other departments, you are
required to submit code, and there are specific programming
qualifications you need to know before you write any code. Most of the
time, students violate academic integrity just because they don't know
it is a violation. The below tutorial is your one-stop shop of academic
integrity to avoid such situations.

- Carefully read the academic integrity policy for this course, which is found in the syllabus tab on Canvas under "Academic Integrity".

- Please complete this [CSE Integrity of Scholarship Agreement](https://forms.gle/oYjguzUFaziCBGjR9).
By signing this, you acknowledge that you have completed and understood the tutorial as well as the agreement. **Although this part of the assignment is worth 0 points, if you do not complete the CSE Integrity of Scholarship Agreement, then you will receive an F in the course.**

## Part 2: Compile and Run Some Code [10 points]

The last part of this assignment is for you to compile and run your
first piece of code in CSE 11. If you're using **UCSD Linux Cloud** or you
are developing on a machine in the **CSE basement**, then Java is already
installed and configured on your CSE 11 class account so you don't need
to worry about the installation. However, if you prefer to work on a
personal computer, you can find the installation steps below for Windows
and macOS.

**Note:** Any recent version of Java will work for this course. The instructions below show Java 11 as an example, but Java 17, 21, or other versions are perfectly acceptable.

### Install Java (Example: Java 11)

1. Navigate to the following link: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11)

2. Depending on your operating system, select one of the following:

    ![Java Download Options](img/1.png)

3. Installation steps for **Windows**:

    a. Choose the `x64 Installer`

    ![Windows x64 Installer](img/2.png)

    b. It will prompt you to create an Oracle account. Create one, login, and download the executable.

    c. If you receive a password validation error even though your passwords match, try creating the account in an Incognito/Private/InPrivate window.

    ![Oracle Account Creation](img/3.png)

    d. Run the executable that you just downloaded and follow through the setup wizard

    ![Java Installation Wizard](img/4.png)

    e. Install it in the default directory

    f. You should now have this. You can click close:

    ![Java Installation Complete](img/5.png)

4. Installation steps for **MacOS**

    a. If you have a Mac with **Apple Silicon**, choose the `Arm 64 DMG Installer`

    ![Mac ARM DMG Installer](img/6.png)

    b. If you have a Mac with an **Intel chip**, choose `x64 DMG Installer`
    ![Mac x64 Installer](img/7.png)

    c. It will prompt you to create an Oracle account. Create one, login, and download the executable.

    d. If you receive a password validation error even though your passwords match, try creating the account in an Incognito/Private/InPrivate window.
    ![Password Validation Error](img/8.png)

    e. Open the `.pkg` installer and follow through the installation instructions

    ![Mac Java Installation Package](img/9.png)

    f. Click "Continue" and you should see this:

    ![Mac Java Installation Continue](img/10.png)

    g. Provide your login credentials and click "Install". After installation, you should see the following:

    ![Mac Java Installation Complete](img/11.png)

    h. Click "close" and you're done!

**Note:** It's perfectly fine to see version `11.0.xx` (where `xx` is higher than `18`) in the above screenshots.

### Toggling Between Installed Java Versions

If you are on Mac and have more than one version of Java installed, the
following steps will show you how to set the default version of Java to
your preferred version (Java 11 is used as an example below).

*If you are on Windows, ask on Piazza or come to office hours. We will
provide information on this if there's demand.*

1. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    $ /usr/libexec/java_home -V
    ```

    You should see output that looks like this:

    ```
    Matching Java Virtual Machines (3):

    12.0.2, x86_64: "Java SE 12.0.2"
    /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-12.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home

    11.0.2, x86_64: "Java SE 11.0.2"
    /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home

    1.8.0_131, x86_64: "Java SE 8"
    /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_131.jdk/Contents/Home

    /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-12.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home
    ```

    Please ensure that you have a Java installation (any recent version will work).

2. Pick your preferred Java version and set it to default by running the following command (Java 11 example):

    ```bash
    $ export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11`
    ```

    You can also copy the exact version like this:

    ```bash
    $ export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11.0.2`
    ```

### Verify Java Installation

Now you should have Java configured, but how can you verify this?

Open your terminal and navigate to a directory where you'd like to work. 

**Tip:** Consider creating a dedicated folder for your CSE 11 work, such as `CSE11` in your Desktop or Documents folder, to keep your assignments organized.

Then, run the following command:

**Linux and macOS:**
```bash
$ java -version
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
> java -version
```

You should see the Java version now. 

**Note:** If you run into issues when running these commands after you've 
installed Java, you may either need to:

1. Restart your terminal and run the commands again

2. Make changes to your system Path variable (though this is typically not necessary): [https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html)

Now that we have Java installed, let's try to compile and run a piece
of code from the command line.

### Visual Studio Code

You can use any text editor (e.g., Vim, Notepad (Windows), TextEdit
(macOS)) you want to edit the files in your programming assignments. You
also have cloud-based options like **GitHub Codespaces**, which provides a
complete development environment in your browser without requiring local
installation. Do not use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that
automatically generates source code, as 1) you need to learn how to write
all source code yourself and 2) the resulting source code often will fail
to compile and/or run in Gradescope, resulting in a score of 0! Here, we
will be installing Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a lightweight, great
text editor. You can install VS Code by following the link below.

1. Navigate to this link: [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

2. Download the respective executable:

    a. For Windows:

    ![VS Code Download Windows](img/12.png)

    b. For macOS:

    ![VS Code Download Mac](img/13.png)

3. Follow the installation instructions depending on your OS.

### Your First Java Program

You will create a new Java file named `Assignment1.java` in Visual Studio Code.

1. Open up Visual Studio Code.

    a. If you are using a personal computer, you can open `Visual Studio Code` like you would with a normal application.

    b. Alternatively, if you are using the **terminal (command line),** you can type in `code` and it should open up Visual Studio Code as well (pretty neat right?).

2. You should be prompted with a page that looks similar to the one below:

    ![Visual Studio Code Welcome Screen](img/14.png)

3. Let's navigate to a folder where you'd like to work on your assignment!

    **Tip:** We recommend creating a dedicated folder for your CSE 11 programming assignments to stay organized. For example, create a folder called `CSE11` on your Desktop or in your Documents folder.

    Click on the Explorer tab and select "Open Folder" in VS Code to locate your desired directory.

    ![VS Code Open Folder](img/15.png)

4. We should be able to see our file explorer on the left-hand side.

    ![VS Code File Explorer](img/16.png)

5. Next, on the VS Code toolbar at the top, select Terminal â†’ New Terminal.

    ![VS Code Terminal Menu](img/17.png)

6. You just opened up the terminal (command line) in VS Code.

    ![VS Code Integrated Terminal](img/18.png)

7. Now let's create a Java file called `Assignment1.java`. You can do this either from the terminal we just opened or by simply using VS Code.

    a. **Terminal**
    
    Create the `Assignment1.java` file using terminal commands:
    - Mac/Linux: `touch Assignment1.java`
    - Windows: `type nul > Assignment1.java`
    ![Creating Java File in Terminal](img/19.png)

    b. **VS Code**

    Use the `add file` icon.

    ![VS Code Add File Icon](img/20.png)

    Name the file.

    ![Naming the Java File](img/21.png)

8. Type the contents of the screenshot below into your newly created `Assignment1.java` file

    ![Java Code Template](img/22.png)

9. Then, you need to write two lines of code below `// Put your code below`

    a. **My name is \<your name\>** starting from a new line. You'll need to use the `System.out.println` method to accomplish this. Refer to the source code line that prints out `"Hello World!"` but replace the text between the double quotation marks with `My name is <your name>`

    b. Then on another new line, tell the class what your favorite hobby is: **My favorite hobby is \<what your favorite hobby is\>**

10. Save this file by navigating to the top left-hand corner again or by pressing **Ctrl + S** (Windows) or **Cmd + S** (Mac) at the same time.

    ![VS Code Save File](img/23.png)

    You will know if your new code is saved when the white dot next to the filename at the top of the tab disappears. In the below screenshot, recent changes to `Assignment1.java` are unsaved.

    ![Unsaved File Indicator](img/24.png)

11. After that, go back to the terminal and make sure you are in the same directory where you saved your `Assignment1.java` file. Before you run every Java code, you need to compile it first using the `javac` command.

    **Important Note:** If you make changes to a `.java` file, you will need to compile your code again before you can run the file with the updated changes.

    **Linux and macOS:**
    ```bash
    $ javac Assignment1.java
    ```

    **Windows:**
    ```cmd
    > javac Assignment1.java
    ```

    Notice that a brand new `.class` file appeared in your directory after compiling!

    ![Compiled Java Class File](img/25.png)

    Then you can run the program using the `java` command.

    **Linux and macOS:**
    ```bash
    $ java Assignment1
    ```

    **Windows:**
    ```cmd
    > java Assignment1
    ```

    You should see three lines of output in the terminal.

    ```
    Hello World!

    My name is Sumu

    My favorite hobby is acting
    ```

## Submission Instructions

**VERY IMPORTANT: Please follow the instructions below carefully and
make the exact submission format.**
